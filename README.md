## Recommended Usage

```
Pipeline:
  tickets + qa_pairs  →  Intent Classifier (NLP)
  policy docs         →  Vector DB (FAISS/ChromaDB) for RAG
  transactions        →  Fraud Classification Model (XGBoost/Random Forest)
  qa_pairs            →  Evaluation / ground truth for RAG retrieval
```

### Run the RAG assistant

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment or in a `.env` file in the project
directory. Optionally set `OPENAI_MODEL` to select a chat model; the default is
`gpt-4o-mini`.

```powershell
python main.py
python main.py --query "How do I report an unauthorized transaction?"
```

The first run creates a local Chroma index in `chroma_db`. Rebuild it after
changing the source data or policies:

```powershell
python main.py --rebuild --query "How do I report an unauthorized transaction?"
```

The assistant returns JSON containing the response, detected intent and
sentiment, an optional context-supported risk level and suggested action, and
the source files used. It is a support prototype, not an account-specific
fraud determination or substitute for the bank's operational procedures.

## Notes
- All amounts in Indian Rupees (INR)
- All data is synthetic — no real PII
- Policy documents reflect common Indian banking regulations (RBI, PMLA, FEMA)
- Expand tickets dataset by augmenting with paraphrasing models
